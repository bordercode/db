<p>During the last fifteen years, T2D mortality showed an explosive pattern at the border states. This growth rate pattern departs from the trend followed by all other death causes.</p>
<p>In particular, a rapid growth trajectory at the <strong>southern border</strong> is evident, with a widening gap by the end of the study period. This trend reaches a 169% increase in <strong>Quintana Roo</strong> by 2019 relative to the base year 1998, with an annual 8.45% average growth rate.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the biggest gap between the overall mortality levels and diabetes mortality is observed in <strong>Chiapas</strong>, with a gap equivalent to <strong>109.8%</strong> between diabetes mortality, which register a <strong>149.8%</strong> accumulated growth during the period 1998-2017 compared to a moderate <strong>39.9%</strong> mortality growth for all other causes.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that, among the northern border states there is also an accelerated growth trend, we find smaller gaps in this region.</p>
<p>In fact, the smallest gap between Diabetes mortality trends and the overall path is found in Sonora and it’s equivalent to <strong>12.8%</strong>, which is just a reflection of the fact that Diabetes is defining “pulling” the observed mortality trend.</p>
<p>In these states Diabetes is so prevalent that it’s behaviour is shaping the over all mortality trayectory.</p>
<p>This contrast relative to the southern border suggest significant and fast regional changes in the Mexican population health, as well as important implications for the health care system as a whole, it is important to remember that Diabetes is considered a high financial impact disease from the perspective of the Health care system.</p>
The following graphs shows a closer look a the trend in each region.
