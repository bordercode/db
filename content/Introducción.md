The evolution of type II diabetes as a death cause in Mexico increased by 97.6% during the period between 1998-2017, while the over all death causes experienced a 44.3% increase in same period. The exponential growth rate implicit by this trend reflects a public health concern of epidemic proportions.

Although diabetes is a major public health problem in Mexico previously thought to be related to population with relative higher income levels or affluent, recent studies had suggested an epidemiological transition impacting individuals in lower income regions.

Studies conducted with a focus on the Mexican population suggest that this transition may be linked to nutritional changes (Seuring, Goryakin & Suhrcke, 2015). Argument that highlights the importance to consider social determinants of health such as consumption patterns as contextual factors to understand this growing public health treat.

Studies emphasizing behavioral determinants have established that inadequate diet is a key risk factor for the development of T2D (Sundquist, Eriksson, Mezuk & Ohlsson, 2015; Wali, Thomas & Sutherland, 2014). According to Ortiz-Hernández (2006), a link towards diabetes development through consumption practices finds a key path via the metabolic energy intake balance; the path identified can be traced back to life style habits further pressured by low price per calories processed foods available at the
neighborhood scale.

As evidence suggest, diet follow trends tied to consumption practices that differ across demographic groups and regions (Gordon-Larsen, Guilkey and Popkin, 2011). Although it is recognized that T2D is a multifactorial public health issue and its determinants are not limited to consumption patterns, considering contextual factors may provide additional insights to improve its understanding at a regional scale.

Despite the importance of geographic location to explain this epidemic, in the past decades the study of biological risk factors has been the dominant paradigm (Graves and Kayal, 2008; Stolar 2010). While research on environmental correlates of physical activity such as obesity, a well-known risk factor for the development of diabetes (Day and Baily, 2011) has been well documented in the US Mexico border communities (Fisher-Hoch et al., 2010). 

There is a clear research gap relative to diabetes studies for the Mexican southern border states and its connections to population consumption
patterns at a local level.

The contrasting demographic profiles found across regions in Mexico constitute a rich area for research to help explain and develop preventive measures to control this epidemic. Additionally, research to date has not extensively examined the geographic distribution and the evolution in time of T2D mortality in Mexico, in particular, the contrast between opposite regions in the country such as the northern and southern border states offer a unique research perspective. While the northern border states, a region with a relative high household income profile receives cultural influence that


shapes population consumption patterns given its geographic proximity to the US; the
southern border region, characterized by lower income levels, concentrate the highest
proportion of indigenous population in the whole country, with reports as high as 97%
of the total in some Chiapas Municipalities and similar proportions found at Campeche
where at least one third of the populations is indigenous according to official census
data (Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas, 2010).
Indigenous population represent a demographic group with dietary patterns often
associated to a low intake of protein suppliers (Romano, Guerrero and García, 2014)
and a high food poverty incidence.


A question that emerges in this context is: how these locational features found at
contrasting border communities are reflected in the population health status as
measured by diabetes mortality rates? In this context, the aim of this analysos is to study type II diabetes mortality rates geographic distribution and its evolution in time across both Mexican border regions during the last 20 years.</div>
